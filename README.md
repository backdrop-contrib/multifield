# Multifield

This project seeks to provide a true compound field solution for Backdrop.

## Limitations

 - The sub-fields inside the multifield are limited to one value. You can have a multiple value multifield, but the individual fields in in the multifield can only have one value.
 - You cannot have a multifield inside another multifield.
 - I've tried to test this with all the core field types, but more advanced fields may cause issues. I haven't run into any yet, but just be aware and test what you want to use.
 - I will be the first to admit, this solution is doing all kinds of unholy things to Backdrop's field and entity APIs, so there may be unexpected dragons laying around that I haven't discovered.
